The website allows the user to explore the data in two ways. In the "Dashboard" section, the user selects a single subject from a dropdown menu. The page then displays the subject's demographic data; a bargraph showing the abundance of the 10 most abundant OTUs; a bubble chart showing all OTUs, with bubbles sized to represent abundance; and a (silly) gauge showing how often the subject reported washing - per week, I guess.

This data is in my field and would actually be analyzed a bit differently in real life. As a step towards that, the second part of the site allows the subjects to be sorted by demographic characteristics, producing a list of selected IDs, which in the next step would be used to create more useful graphics. Didn't get to that.

Behind the scenes, there is a data file; an index.html file laying out the website; and an app.js file sorting the data and setting up the graphs.
